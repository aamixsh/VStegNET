# VStegNET

## Disclaimer: The code is old and badly written/documented (regrets!). If you can't get it to work, please use the network architecture as template, as that is correct and worked perfectly when this was written. 

For training/testing the model, make the following changes in the *stego_net.py* file,
1. change the global variable *train_loc*, *test_loc* to the desired directory.
2. add code for image resize, if required, in the generator functions.
3. Uncomment the *m.train()* or *m.test()* lines at the end of the file, as required.
